# Client-Server-Group-Project
Group Project: Build a simple client/server network. Create a dictionary, populate it, serialize it and send it to a server. Create a text file and send it to a server. With the dictionary, the user should be able to set the pickling format to one of the following binary, JSON and XML. Also, the user will need to have the option to encrypt the text in a text file. The server should have a configurable option to print the contents of the sent items to the screen and or to a file. Also, the server will need to be able to handle encrypted contents. The client and server can be on separate machines or on the same machine. Make sure that the code is written to PEP standard and uses exception handling to handle potential errors. Write unit tests. Upload the project to your source control website. Make sure that the commits have messages that describe the changes. Make sure the code is documented.
Members of the group should provide a code review to each other's code. The team should assign the following roles to the team members. If you have less than four members, then team members can have more than one role.
1.	Project Manager: manages the project
2.	Software Architect: designs the solution
3.	Software Engineer: writes the code
4.	Tester: tests the code

You will need to submit your code and a report of between 1000 and 1500 words. Your code submission should include your directory tree as well as code documentation. This should include as a minimum a Readme.md and requirements.txt as well as other documentation that you may see fit to include. In addition, the log of Github/GitLab push comments and code reviews should be included.
Be sure that all contents are easily accessible. If you use an online service (i.e. GitLab), make sure settings allow anyone with the direct link to access the repo, even after receiving your grade. 
NOTE: Working in Groups – Basic Expectations
It is generally necessary, where possible, to have each member of the group work on a different part or aspect of the mini-project and its write-up. Use your group forum to decide who does what.
Peer Assessment:
Peer assessment provides a structured learning process for students to critique and give feedback to each other on their work. The process helps students develop lifelong skills in assessing and providing feedback to others and equips them with self-assess skills and improving their own work.
As part of this group activity, you are asked to be involved in peer moderation: you are required to assess yourself and each group member's contribution to the group product. You can download the Peer Group Assessment Form and submit it in the Peer Assessment Submission area.
To submit your response to this assignment
•	Nominate one of your group members to upload the deliverables below. This submission point is shared among all members of your group: this means any member can see and edit the submission when in draft mode. Be sure all documents you want to submit are in place before submitting the assignment. Do not submit your Peer Group Assessment Form here, use the dedicated submission point.
•	Upload your individual Peer Group Assessment Form to the Peer Assessment submission area in Week 5
